# CSS-Introduction
Repository contains some exercises / challenges solved during the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freeCodeCamp.org) for Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours).

## css-folder
The css folder contains basic Css manipulations. The files (fullCard-main.css, penguin-main.css, space-main.css) are using features like:  
* :root ==> The :root selector matches the document's root element. In HTML, the root element is always the html element. * box-shadow ==> The box-shadow property attaches one or more shadows to an element. * linear-gradient ==> The linear-gradient() function sets a linear gradient as the background image. * repeating-linear-gradient ==> The repeating-linear-gradient() function is used to repeat linear gradients. * @keyframes ==> The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code. The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another. * Custom properties ==> Sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables, are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. They are set using custom property notation (e.g., --main-color: black;) and are accessed using the var() function (e.g., color: var(--main-color);). * transform ==> The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
